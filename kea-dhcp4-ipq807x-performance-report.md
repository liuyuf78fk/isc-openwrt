## Detailed Performance Analysis (Target Rate: 400 exchanges/sec)
| Item                      | Value                | Evaluation                   |
|---------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Actual Rate               | 399.98 exchanges/sec | âœ… Perfectly achieved         |
| DISCOVER-OFFER Drop Rate  | 1 / 94857 â‰ˆ 0.001%   | âœ… Nearly zero packet loss    |
| REQUEST-ACK Drop Rate     | 2 / 94856 â‰ˆ 0.0021%  | âœ… Extremely low packet loss  |
| DISCOVER-OFFER Avg Delay  | 4.537 ms             | âœ… Very low latency           |
| REQUEST-ACK Avg Delay     | 4.832 ms             | âœ… Very low latency           |
| Max Delay (Overall)       | \~33 ms               | âœ… Fully acceptable           |
| Malformed / Rejected / Orphans | All zero        | âœ… Protocol handled perfectly |
| Short Waits               | 1,912,000            | ðŸ”µ Normal behavior indicating high processing density |

### Overall Evaluation
- Extremely stable: At 400 4-way exchanges/sec, packet loss is nearly zero, showing Kea runs stably on AX6.
- Low and balanced latency: No backlog, queueing or spikes, indicating well-coordinated system scheduling, socket buffers, and CPU.
- Good hardware-software match: Indicates OpenWrt config, Kea compile options, and kernel UDP buffers are well optimized.
- High short waits: Means packets arrive frequently and the system keeps up, which is normal behavior.

**Note:** This is a preliminary and not fully rigorous performance test. The Qualcomm IPQ807X processor has 4 cores, but this test used only 2 threads, so CPU usage reached roughly 50% at peak load. Additionally, the WiFi connection introduces extra latency. Using a wired Ethernet connection and increasing to 4 threads could yield better performance and higher throughput.
